# Requirements for Streamlit Cloud deployment
# Streamlit Cloud currently uses Python 3.13 which is NOT yet supported by OpenBB 4.x.
# We therefore omit OpenBB and rely on yfinance. If you want OpenBB, add a runtime.txt
# with a supported Python (e.g. python-3.12.3) and then pin: openbb==3.2.4

streamlit>=1.36
pandas>=2.2
numpy>=1.26
yfinance>=0.2.50
requests>=2.31
python-dotenv>=1.0
# Optional extras
# plotly>=5.24
# scipy>=1.11
# openbb==3.2.4  # Uncomment ONLY if you add runtime.txt with python-3.12.x
